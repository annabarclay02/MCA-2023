## Week 1
### Task 2 
Theme: Taylor Swift

> For my Music Curation and Analytics project I have chosen to focus on American country/pop artist Taylor Swift. I have chosen Taylor Swift as I have a lot of admiration for her work and her prominence and status within the music industry.

> As my most streamed artist, I have very familiar with her extensive discography and her impact on the industry. Over her 17 year career, she has released 13 studio albums, including 3 of her 6 planned re-recorded albums. The 4th, *'1989 (Taylor's Version)'*, is set to release on October 27th. She has also released a variety of live singles and EPs, remixes, and alternative versions of songs.

> She holds 49 Grammy nominations, including 12 wins and has earned 9 no.1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
