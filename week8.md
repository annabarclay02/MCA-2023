# Week 8: Music as Sound
## Task 1: Identifying other relevant audio tracks
### My chosen audios
For this task I have chosen three different Taylor Swift songs. Her 17 year career and constant reinvention means that each of her 'eras' has a very unique and identifable sound. For this reason, I have chosen one song from her first album, a song from her fifth album, and a song from her seventh album. Each of these albums represents a different time in her life and hence, very different sounds. Her first album is a country album, her fifth is her poppiest album, and her seventh is one of her more mature and mellow albums albeit still very pop. 

The songs I have chosen aplty represent these differences as I have opted to use one of her most obviously country sounding songs, one of her poppiest, and one of her slowest songs. I hope these factors will be represented in the analysis.

### Advantages of time frequency analysis
There are many advantages to using time frequency analysis over a waveform. One being that spectrograms can represent timbre amd instrumentation a lot better than waveforms. By looking at the False God spectrogram we can clearly identify that the song has a strong, even beat that can be heard throughout the music. Spectrograms allow us to see the amount of energy the frequencies of the music have. Higher energy equals higher pitch and this is represented by colours such as oranges and reds, lower levels of energy are represented by green. Since the rest of the instrumentation is low and mellow we can deduct that in this specific spectrogram, many of the higher energy parts represent Swift's vocals. If we take specifically the first 16 counts of the song: it begins with a solo saxophone intro with a jazzy and mellow sound. The song then breaks into Swift singing, and a steady beat is introduced on every whole count. In the spectrogram we can clearly see when the solo ends and the beat starts as well as Swift's vocals. Comparing this to the waveform - we can only see that the volume is clearly low in the intro and gets louder after the intro. We can see the beat represented in the waveform, however, we can't see any higher energy areas such as the vocals. Another example of the spectrogram representing the instrumentation very well is around halfway through the song where a hi-hat is introduced on every quarter note. The spectrogram clearly represents this and it can be seen in the sharp spikes throughout. Below are screenshots of the specific sections of the spectrogram mentioned above.
