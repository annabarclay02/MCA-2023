# Week 8: Music as Sound
## Task 1: Identifying other relevant audio tracks
### My chosen audios
For this task I have chosen three different Taylor Swift songs. Her 17 year career and constant reinvention means that each of her 'eras' has a very unique and identifable sound. For this reason, I have chosen one song from her first album, a song from her fifth album, and a song from her seventh album. Each of these albums represents a different time in her life and hence, very different sounds. Her first album is a country album, her fifth is her poppiest album, and her seventh is one of her more mature and mellow albums albeit still very pop. 

The songs I have chosen aplty represent these differences as I have opted to use one of her most obviously country sounding songs, one of her poppiest, and one of her slowest songs. I hope these factors will be represented in the analysis.
