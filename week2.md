## Week 2
### Task 1: MuseScore Notation
#### Song: Mirrorball by Taylor Swift
As this is a fairly simple piano and vocal score MuseScore got 90% of the score correct once imported. 

I had a few issues with hidden rests and correcting crochets to quavers but on the whole MuseScore was pretty accurate.
