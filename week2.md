# Week 2: Notation Basics
## Task 1: MuseScore Notation
### Song: Mirrorball by Taylor Swift
As this is a fairly simple piano and vocal score MuseScore got about 90% of the score correct once imported. 

I had a few issues with hidden rests and correcting crochets to quavers but on the whole MuseScore was pretty accurate. For these corrections I just moved the incorrect rests to the far right of each bar and unticked the visible box to grey them out. 

MuseScore also fails to convert lyrics and I may have to add them manually.
