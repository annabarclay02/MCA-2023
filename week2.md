# Week 2: Notation Basics
## Task 1: MuseScore Notation
### Song: Mirrorball by Taylor Swift
As this is a fairly simple piano and vocal score, MuseScore got about 90% of the score correct once imported. 

I had a few issues with hidden rests and correcting crochets to quavers but on the whole MuseScore was pretty accurate. For these corrections I just moved the incorrect rests to the far right of each bar and unticked the visible box to grey them out. This didn't work for every single rest, however, so the piano score sounds slightly different to the original in sections. For the purposes of this project, it isn't a huge issue but I wouldn't recommend the MuseScore's import and would point user's in the direction of websites with free sheet music. 

MuseScore also failed to convert the lyrics of my piece. They do have the option to add them manually but this would be quite time consuming and complicated. This lack of lyrics has resulted in the vocal section of the piece being represented by choral sounding 'oohs' instead. While they do not sound like the timbre or tone of the original, they provide a decent suggestion of the vocal aspect of the piece and so I am satisfied with the conversion.
