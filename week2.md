# Week 2: Notation Basics
## Task 1: MuseScore Notation
### Song: Mirrorball by Taylor Swift
As this is a fairly simple piano and vocal score MuseScore got about 90% of the score correct once imported. 

I had a few issues with hidden rests and correcting crochets to quavers but on the whole MuseScore was pretty accurate. For these corrections I just moved the incorrect rests to the far right of each bar and unticked the visible box to grey them out. 

MuseScore also failed to convert the lyrics of my piece. They do have the option to add them manually but this may be quite time consuming and complicated.
