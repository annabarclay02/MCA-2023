# Week 7: Challenges to Music Curation
## Task 1: MEI Metadata 
Download of update MEI file is available [here](data/mirrorball_update2.mei).

Below is my added and formatted metadata. I have attempted to fix this issue but the producers and release date don't seem to be presented correctly. The producer line has no title, unlike composer, and the release date is listed as an encoding date.

### Genre
The genre for this piece is Alternative/Indie-Pop/Indie-Folk. I chose to add multiple genres as I feel the song, and album on the whole, crosses a variety of genres. 

Taylor Swift is largely renowned for being a pop singer who got her start in country music. The albums folklore and evermore are her first transgressions into the Indie-Folk sphere, however, she is still overwhelmingly known for her pop music. 

Apple Music considers the album Alternative, while Wikipedia lists it as Dream-Pop and Indie-Folk. For this reason I felt it appropriate to cover a variety of genres within the note statement.  

### Licensing
I have chosen a CC BY-NC 4.0 DEED Creative Commons License for my piece. 
This allows users to share and adapt the work for non-commercial purposes as long as they give appropriate credit.

### Composer
I thought it was relevant to include the composers of the piece as Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff. It is important to highlight that Swift writes all of her own music, hence why she is allowed to re-record her albums that she doesn't own. Antonoff is one of her main collaborators and they have worked together on Swift's last six original albums as well as her re-records.
