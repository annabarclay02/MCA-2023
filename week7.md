## Task 1: MEI Metadata 
[Second updated MEI file with added metadata](data/mirrorball_update2.mei)

### Genre
The genre for this piece as Alternative/Indie-Pop/Indie-Folk. I chose to add multiple genres as I feel the song, and album on the whole, crosses a variety of genres. 

Taylor Swift is largely renowned for being a pop singer who got her start in country music. The albums folklore and evermore are her first transgressions into the Indie-Folk sphere, however, she is still overwhelmingly known for her pop music. 

Apple Music considers the album Alternative, while Wikipedia lists it as Dream-Pop and Indie-Folk. For this reason I felt it appropriate to cover a variety of genres within the note statement.  

### Licensing
I have chosen a CC BY-NC 4.0 DEED Creative Commons License for my piece. 

This allows users to share and adapt the work for non-commercial purposes as long as they give appropriate credit.
