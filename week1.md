# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## Task 1: Theme 
### Theme: Taylor Swift
For my Music Curation and Analytics project I have chosen to focus on American country/pop artist Taylor Swift. I have chosen Taylor Swift as I have a lot of admiration for her work as well as her prominence and status within the music industry.

As my most streamed artist, I have very familiar with her extensive discography and her impact on the industry. Over her 17 year career, she has released 13 studio albums, including 3 of her 6 planned re-recorded albums. The 4th, *'1989 (Taylor's Version)'*, is set to release on October 27th. She has also released a variety of live singles and EPs, remixes, and alternative versions of songs.

She holds 49 Grammy nominations, including 12 wins and has earned 9 no.1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

## Task 2: Types of Data
### Descriptive Data
In terms of descriptive data, the best places to find information on each album are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#) and [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift). Taylor Swift's own [website](https://www.taylorswift.com) operates primarily as a store and a source of information on her current tour and  doesn't provide much information on each individual release. 

Due to her immense popularity and the huge level of information available online about Taylor Swift, each of her albums has its own Wikipedia page, including each re-recording. These [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography) pages include information on the album's composition, its reception, chart information, and individual track information which includes writers and duration. 

Genius also has an extensive amount of information on Taylor's releases and credits the writers, features, and producers. It also provides artist provided and crowdsourced information on the lyrics, helping to add context and narrative to each song. 

Spotify and Apple Music also hold a great amount of metadata on Taylor Swift on their systems. This includes album titles, track titles, track length, number of streams, album and single artwork, similar artists, playlists the artist is featured on, global ranking, upcoming concerts, monthly listeners, and an 'about' section. 

### Notated Data 
Sites such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=taylor%20swift), [SheetMusic-Free](https://sheetmusic-free.com/artist/taylor-swift-sheet-music/), and [SheetMusicDirect](https://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/Search.aspx?query=Taylor%2BSwift) all provide many different scores for Taylor Swift songs. A majority of these are free but some are behind a paywall. A large variety of difficulties and instruments is covered including orchestral pieces, and pieces for specific instruments such as piano, vocal, or violin. 

### Acoustic Data
Acoustic data is readily available online on streaming sites such as Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music etc. Many recordings of live performances are also available on sites such as TikTok and YouTube. Due to the current popularity and phenomenon surrounding Taylor's current tour *'The Eras Tour'*, live recordings are very easy to find and are of good quality.

Many of Taylor's live performances and tours have also been professionally recorded and she has three concert movies with her most recent being released in October 2023 and grossing around $250million at the box office so far.

## Task 3: Challenges
### Access
Many studio recordings of Taylor's may not be accessible without a subscription of some kind to a music streaming site. Some have been posted to YouTube for free access, but these may violate copyright laws and have some issues of fair use involved. Taylor has also previously made her music  unavailable on streaming sites by removing it from 2014-2017 as a way to adocate for small artists and protest streaming sites low payment of their artists. This is currently not an issue as she has since reuploaded all of her music. 

### Curation
I imagine music curation can have a variety of issues including dealing with the volume of music and music data. For example, some composers have thousands of compositions in different keys and for different instruments, all with very similar names that would get confusing and difficult to handle. Sites such as IMSLP overcome this by cataloguing composers with large numbers of compositions by certain codes of letters. This helps to keep track of composers and organise their work accordingly. If we count streaming sites as music curation platforms we can identify many issues that they may encounter. Spotify uploads tens of thousands of songs a day to their site and has to curate their tracks to optimise use of their platform and enhance user experience. Both human and algorithm curation goes into the making of their playlists with main features including Release Radar, Discover Weekly, and Daily Mixes. This kind of curation can suffer from algorithmic bias and can push songs prioritised by Spotify for various reasons such as profit or relationships with record labels, rather than user experience. In terms of large artists, like Taylor Swift, this is unlikely to be a negative for them and would rather affect smaller artists with not as much reach.

### Distribution 
The distribution of music and music data has changed rapidly over the past 60 years, and even the past 10. From records, to casettes, to CDs, and streaming the world of music distribution is expansive and can face many issues. Piracy is a large threat to music distribution, although with the rise of streaming sites this is less prevalanet than, say, 15 years ago. The new age of streaming has effected the music shop business and the distribution of analog music storage. It also infers that people must have access to a computer device and Wi-Fi to enjoy music and due to the effect of streaming on access to analog options, many people may not have the ability to access music any longer. The sheer level of market saturation also effects distribution campaigns from music labels, smaller artists may not get the same marketing and opportunities they might have once received and therefore have a limited reach and smaller distribution numbers and sales. Global distribution also comes with its own set of difficulties, such as licensing regulations, cultural preferences, and language barriers. It is historically difficult for non-English speaking artists to break North America and the U.K., however, many popular genres such as Latin and K-Pop are huge in their own geographical locations and only growing in popularity worldwide. While she is globally successful, Taylor Swift, specifically, has had her fair share of distribution issues, including the acquisition of her masters by Scotter Braun, unbeknownst to her. This acquisition is what triggered her to re-record her albums in order to replace the albums she no longer owned. While this was a huge blow to her at the time, it has led to huge career growth for Swift and has given her ownership and control to license and distribute her music as she likes. This has also impacted the distribution of the original, or 'stolen', versions of her albums as they have decreased in popularity with fans in solidarity with Taylor. On the other hand, the success of Taylor's re-records and her advocating for artists to own their work has led many music labels to add clauses to contracts defining a period of time until they are allowed to re-record their work with some implementing wait times of 20-30 years in order to avoid this kind of success for an artist and subsequent loss for the label.
