# Week 1: Basics of Music Data
## Task 1: Theme 
### Theme: Taylor Swift
For my Music Curation and Analytics project I have chosen to focus on American country/pop artist Taylor Swift. I have chosen Taylor Swift as I have a lot of admiration for her work as well as her prominence and status within the music industry.

As my most streamed artist, I have very familiar with her extensive discography and her impact on the industry. Over her 17 year career, she has released 13 studio albums, including 3 of her 6 planned re-recorded albums. The 4th, *'1989 (Taylor's Version)'*, is set to release on October 27th. She has also released a variety of live singles and EPs, remixes, and alternative versions of songs.

She holds 49 Grammy nominations, including 12 wins and has earned 9 no.1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

## Task 2: Types of Data
### Descriptive Data
In terms of descriptive data, the best places to find information on each album are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift#) and [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift). Taylor Swift's own [website](https://www.taylorswift.com) operates primarily as a store and a source of information on her current tour and  doesn't provide much information on each individual release. 

Due to her immense popularity and the huge level of information available online about Taylor Swift, each of her albums has its own Wikipedia page, including each re-recording. These [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography) pages include information on the album's composition, its reception, chart information, and individual track information which includes writers and duration. 

Genius also has an extensive amount of information on Taylor's releases and credits the writers, features, and producers. It also provides artist provided and crowdsourced information on the lyrics, helping to add context and narrative to each song. 

Spotify and Apple Music also hold a great amount of metadata on Taylor Swift on their systems. This includes album titles, track titles, track length, number of streams, album and single artwork, similar artists, playlists the artist is featured on, global ranking, upcoming concerts, monthly listeners, and an 'about' section. 

### Notated Data 
Sites such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/sheetmusic?text=taylor%20swift), [SheetMusic-Free](https://sheetmusic-free.com/artist/taylor-swift-sheet-music/), and [SheetMusicDirect](https://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/Search.aspx?query=Taylor%2BSwift) all provide many different scores for Taylor Swift songs. A majority of these are free but some are behind a paywall. A large variety of difficulties and instruments is covered including orchestral pieces, and pieces for specific instruments such as piano, vocal, or violin. 

### Acoustic Data
Acoustic data is readily available online on streaming sites such as Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music etc. Many recordings of live performances are also available on sites such as TikTok and YouTube. Due to the current popularity and phenomenon surrounding Taylor's current tour *'The Eras Tour'*, live recordings are very easy to find and are of good quality.

Many of Taylor's live performances and tours have also been professionally recorded and she has two concert movies with another due to release in October.

## Task 3: Challenges
### Access
Many studio recordings of Taylor's may not be accessible without a subscription of some kind to a music streaming site. Some have been posted to YouTube for free access, but these may violate copyright laws and have some issues of fair use involved. Taylor has also previously made her music  unavailable on streaming sites by removing it from 2014-2017 as a way to adocate for small artists and protest streaming sites low payment of their artists. This is currently not an issue as she has since reuploaded all of her music.
