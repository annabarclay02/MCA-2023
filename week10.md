# Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription
## Task 1: Similarity Matrix
Using the same three sections as in Week 9, I extracted the chroma features and saved them as CSV files in order to create a similarity matrix using Python. For the purposes of this matrix, tracks 0-3 are classical pieces, tracks 4-6 are rock pieces, and tracks 7, 8, and 9 are my three sections of the song *mirrorball*. I would place tracks 7-9 in the genre of indie/folk. Track 7 represents the bridge, track 8 represents the chorus, and track 9 represents the bridge.
