# Week 3: Encoding Basics for Notation
## Task 1
This week we had the task of converting our mcsz file into a MusicXML file, and then from a MusicXML file into an MEI file.
This was done using MuseScore and Verovio.

Below is my MEI file of Taylor Swift's song 'Mirrorball' from her eighth studio album *folklore*.

## My Score
