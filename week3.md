# Week 3: Encoding Basics for Notation
## Task 1
This week we had the task of converting our mcsz file into a MusicXML file, and then from a MusicXML file into an MEI file.
This was done using MuseScore and Verovio.

Below is my MEI file of Taylor Swift's song 'Mirrorball' from her eighth studio album *folklore*.

## Differences of MEI and MusicXML
MEI and MusicXML have a large variety of differences, especially in terms of their respective hierarchies.
XML focusses on 'note' as the parent element and most other elements as the child elements. 
MEI, on the other hand, foccusses on staffs and measures as the parent elements.
